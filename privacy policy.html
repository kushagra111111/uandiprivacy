    </header>

    <section class="card">
      <p>U&amp;I (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, with whom we share it, and your choices.</p>

      <h2 id="1">1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information necessary to operate the U&amp;I app and provide its key features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your name and phone number, used for creating your account, enabling secure OTP-based login, and verifying identity during partner pairing or connection requests (including when partner pairing is completed via OTP verification).</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Real-time and background location information, used only when you enable location sharing (by switching on the location sharing button and granting permission) to securely share your location with a paired partner for safety and tracking.</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth Connection Data:</strong> Information required to connect and communicate with paired wearable devices (e.g., device identifier and connection state). The app requests Bluetooth permissions to pair with and send signals to your band/device; Bluetooth functionality may operate while the app is in the background if you have an active, paired connection and have enabled the relevant feature.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not collect any other personal, device, or analytics data beyond what is required for these features.</p>

      <h2 id="2">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use collected information for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your account and authenticate you securely (OTP).</li>
        <li>To enable partner pairing and verification via OTP, and to manage partner connections.</li>
        <li>To provide core features such as live location sharing (when enabled), safety alerts, and communication between paired users.</li>
        <li>To connect to and send signals to paired Bluetooth devices (bands) for device control and safety features when you have an active pairing.</li>
        
      </ul>

      <h2 id="3">3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your personal information. We may share limited information with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google LLC):</strong> Used for authentication and cloud database storage to securely manage user accounts and partner pairing data.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Maps Platform:</strong> Used to display maps and routes when location sharing is enabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Your paired partner:</strong> When you explicitly choose to share your live location or status within the app.</li>
       
      </ul>
      <p class="note">If we add additional third-party services that access personal data, we will update this policy and list those services here.</p>

      <h2 id="4">4. Location Data Details &amp; Permissions</h2>
      <p>The app requests access to device location. You control this permission through your device settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>While in use:</strong> Location is used when you actively enable location sharing by switching on the location sharing button in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Background location (optional):</strong> If you enable background location, the app may access location while the app is not in the foreground to provide uninterrupted safety tracking and to securely share location updates with your paired partner. Background location is only used when you explicitly enable it in the app and grant the necessary system permission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">You can revoke location permissions at any time in your device’s system settings. Disabling location access or turning off the location sharing button will limit location-based features and prevent ongoing background location sharing.</p>

      <h2 id="5">5. Bluetooth Permissions &amp; Background Operation</h2>
      <p>To connect with and control wearable bands/devices, U&amp;I requests Bluetooth permissions. Bluetooth access is used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discover and pair with your wearable band or device.</li>
        <li>Send control signals or alerts from the app to the paired device as part of safety features.</li>
        <li>Maintain an active connection so the device can receive signals; this may require the app to operate in the background when you have an active pairing and have enabled the related features.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">You can unpair devices or revoke Bluetooth-related permissions via your device settings; doing so will disable band-related features.</p>

      

      <h2 id="6">7. How to Delete Your Account</h2>
      <p>You may delete your account using the in-app <em>Delete Account</em> feature. Alternatively, you can request account deletion here:</p>
      <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOmkb-fTe_FpCBGtVMNZjg6SsgKxRo4TuAnybQLlR7j_Xigw/viewform?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Account Deletion Request Form</a></p>

      <h2 id="7">8. Security</h2>
      <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against loss, theft, and unauthorized access. Measures include encrypted transmission (HTTPS), OTP-based authentication, and regular monitoring. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2 id="8">9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The app is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

      <h2 id="9">10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the <em>Last updated</em> date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

      <h2 id="10">11. Contact Us</h2>
